## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Requests

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/mevanuryazicioglu/Kriptoloji_Projesi/

## How to Run

This project uses a client-server architecture. You need to run both the server and client:

### 1. Start the Server
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python3 server.py
```
The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 2. Start the Client (GUI)
Open another terminal and run:
```bash
python3 client.py
```
